 samplerate, a package for high quality samplerate convertion
===============================================================

samplerate is a python module to do high quality resampling of audio signals, using
sinc interpolation. samplerate gives you functionalities similar to resample in
matlab (the actual resampling method may differ, though), and is intended to be used
with numpy arrays.

The above figure plots the error signal for a 1000 Hz sinusoid converted
from 44.1 Khz to 48 Khz (compare to an sinusoid directly sampled @ 48 khz). The
script used to generate the figure is here:

LICENSE
-------

samplerate is released under the GPL license (the same as SRC).

Usage
=====

Hopefully coming soon :)

TODO:
=====

For now, samplerate is very limited, and supports only constant ratio. But SRC
itself is able to do ratio which change overtime. Also, no error reporting is
done yet. It is usable as a matlab resample, though, which is why I started
this in the first place.

===============

Please note that samplerate is essentially a wrapper around the `Sampling Rate
Conversion library <http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/>`_, aka Source Rabbit Code,
the high quality sampling rate convertion library of Erik Castrop de Lopo. All
the features of samplerate are his owns, all the bugs mine.
